# Render Free Deployment Checklist

This is the first hosting path for the Company Board PWA. It is intended for a free public demo, not final production.

## What Render Will Run

- Runtime: Node
- Plan: Free
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Health check: `/api/health`
- Required secret: `HR_PIN`

These settings are defined in `render.yaml`.

## Steps

1. Create or open a Render account.
2. Click **New > Blueprint**.
3. Connect this GitHub repository.
4. Confirm the service named `company-board-pwa`.
5. Enter a secure `HR_PIN` when Render asks for secret environment variables.
6. Click **Apply**.
7. Wait for the deploy to finish.

## Links After Deploy

Replace `your-render-url` with the URL Render gives you.

- Employee board: `https://your-render-url.onrender.com/#employee`
- HR dashboard: `https://your-render-url.onrender.com/#admin`

## Phone Install

On iPhone:

1. Open the employee board link in Safari.
2. Tap Share.
3. Tap **Add to Home Screen**.

On Android:

1. Open the employee board link in Chrome.
2. Tap the menu.

## Demo Limitations

- Free Render services can sleep after inactivity.

- Local JSON storage can reset on redeploy or instance replacement.

- Push notifications are not included yet.

## Production Upgrade After Approval

Move to:

- Real HR login
